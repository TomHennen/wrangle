# wrangle

Wrangle is a toy project where I try to figure out if we can easily
integrate best practices and all the various tools available for
users without them needing to know all the details.

NOTE: I've never really used GitHub for professional development
before, so this is a bit of a learning process too.

## Next
  - Figure out how to display results to the user.
    Maybe each tool is a 'test' and we use https://github.com/ctrf-io and [github-test-reporter](https://github.com/ctrf-io/github-test-reporter) to integrate nicely?
