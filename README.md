# wrangle

Wrangle is a toy project where I try to figure out if we can easily
integrate best practices and all the various tools available for
users without them needing to know all the details.

NOTE: I've never really used GitHub for professional development
before, so this is a bit of a learning process too.

## Next
  - ensure we can run locally easily too
  - https://github.com/ctrf-io/ctrf-cli for test results
